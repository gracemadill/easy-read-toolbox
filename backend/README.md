# Easy Read Toolkit API

This package exposes a lightweight Express server that powers the Easy Read Toolkit demo.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

- `npm start` & `npm run dev` both start the server at `http://localhost:5000`.
- Set `PORT`, `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` or `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` (for the client) in a `.env` file if you need different values.

See the repository root `README.md` for the complete list of endpoints and usage notes.
